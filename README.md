This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: ZeroDivisionError. The `calculate_average` function attempts to calculate the average of a list of numbers. However, if the input list is empty, it leads to division by zero. The solution demonstrates how to handle this error gracefully by checking if the list is empty before performing the calculation.
